# Robo friends

Simple ReactJS based application.

## Application deploy
Actually, I integrated this repository with `Travis CI`, so after each push into the **master** branch 
the project will be automatically built and deployed into the gh-pages branch.

As an alternative, I installed `gh-pages` package to build and deploy application manually. You can use it 
for the when you do not want push your data or, probably, you work in another branch.

In the case of using `Travis CI` **gh-page** branch will be created automatically after first deploy.
